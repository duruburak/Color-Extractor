# Color-Extractor

<span style="color: red;">Color Extractor:</span> An app made with Python that takes an image in various formats and gives back the most recurring 15 color codes.

<span style="color: purple;">Available formats:</span> JPG (JPEG) | PNG | GIF | TIFF | BMP | PPM

### How to use
You can either install the .exe file named "Color Extractor.exe" to your computer or you can run the code on your computer.

Once you're ready, all you need to do is click "Upload Image", select an image and WAIT!

⚠️ The wait time varies by the factors of extensions and resolutions. So it may take minutes to finish the process, be patient. ⚠️

ℹ️ YOU CAN SWITCH BETWEEN RGB AND HEX VALUES ℹ️

ℹ️ CLICK COLOR CODES TO COPY TO CLIPBOARD ℹ️

### How does it work
It takes an image then goes through all pixels one by one, and calculates which 15 color codes appear the most and gives you them.

Since it's Python and goes through all pixels one by one manually and doesn't get help from any AI, that's why it might take some time to finish the process.

But that's not all, it also shows where do all those 15 colors recur in that picture by showing only the top colors appearinn on the right.

You can even change the background color by switching the "Toggle Color" to see more clearly.
